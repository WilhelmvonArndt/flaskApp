# Flask-MongoDB Web App

### Title
The title of this app is _Animalmash_,

### Description

_Animalmash_ is a take om Marc Zuckerberg's '06 project _Facemash_ which laid the foundation to his idea of creating Facebook, but instead of having the user select a female student of Harvard University, they are chosing the cutest animal displayed. The CSS was inspired from screenshots taken from movie [The Social Network](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/thesocialnetwork/images/6/68/Facemash.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130914200210), as I was unfortunetely unable to use a tool such as [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to find the authentic HTML and CSS of the actual website.

There is seemingly no delete function for the regular user. The delete function can be acessed by navigating to the submit page and entering _Nimda_ in BOTH of the fields and pressing **Post**, which will effectively redirect you to the _/admin_ url. Note that the /admin page cannot be accessed by typing in the the URL in the navbar.
